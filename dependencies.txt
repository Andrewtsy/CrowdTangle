"""ENVIRONMENT SETUP"""

PYTHON
	Install Python (if not already installed) Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/


CROWDTANGLE EXTENSION
	There is the crx file for CrowdTangle included in the repo, however one may need to install a different type if one has a different chrome version.
		The one included in the repo is for Chrome version 91.0.4472.114. One can check their own Chrome version by clicking on the 3 dots in upper left corner of the Google browser->Help->About Google Chrome
			Link for more info on getting Chrome version: https://www.businessinsider.com/what-version-of-google-chrome-do-i-have
			(one can skip the crowdtangle extension installation steps and use the included crx if one's version matches 91.0.4472.114)

	There are a couple of ways to obtain a different Chrome version crx file if needed. The easiest way is to copy and paste this link template into chrome.

		Replace [PROVERSION] with your current Chrome version (information on how to obtain one's Chrome version is described above).
			Link to info on link template: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7184793/how-to-download-a-crx-file-from-the-chrome-web-store-for-a-given-id

		Once downloaded, rename the file to 'crowdtangle.crx' and move to base directory and replace old crx file.




[IMPORTANT: ALTHOUGH NOT REQUIRED, SOME TYPE OF VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT/PACKAGE MANAGER RECOMMENDED TO KEEP NEEDED PACKAGES SEPARATE FROM OTHERS I.E. PIP IS IFFY]
	Link to guides on python's virtual environments if one is curious: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
							 		   https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
		Note: if used, most package managers should have some sort of equivalent environment tool (I used anaconda and conda environments) and one can search up specific manager installation steps for each package.
	Link to article using homebrew and virtualenv as an example: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-setup-your-python-projects-1eb5108086b1
	One should use a terminal – command line/prompt/bash/etc. to navigate to the project directory (and initiate environment if wanted) and execute the following installations.


SELENIUM
	If not already installed, setup steps for Selenium & driver
		Step 1: install Selenium using package manager
			if using pip enter the following into terminal: pip install selenium
				Link to Selenium Python docs for more info: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
	 	Step 2: download ChromeDriver for applicable Chrome version (found from before) and set executable path
			There is a zipped ChromeDriver file in the repo one can use for reference if they have Chrome version 91.0.4472.114. It'd probably be wise to follow the following steps anyway, and replace the ref file anyway, however.
				Link for download: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
				Link to info on setting path (this depends more on one's preferences, so I'm setting the docs for reference): https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/

	Note: I followed roughly the above path for my system, however there might be an easier alternative using homebrew.
		I haven't tried it, but this Medium article seems good:

PYAUTOGUI
	Pyautogui should be relatively straightforward (reminder that some sort of virtual environment/package manager is recommended)
		if using pip enter the following into terminal: pip install pyautogui
			Link to pyautogui installation docs for more info: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html


OPENCV (this is used in a relatively minor but important part used for locate by image confidence measures)
	Install opencv3
		if using pip enter the following into terminal: pip install opencv-python
			Link to pypi opencv for more installation info: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
			Link to opencv docs (not really necessary but if one's curious): https://docs.opencv.org/master/

Note: Environment setup can be a pain – I had some trouble figuring this out myself – but you'll get through it :). If you have questions, you can contact me at andrew.sy.tao@gmail.com
